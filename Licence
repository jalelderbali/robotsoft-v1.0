You must have the DirectX and SlimdX and Windows SDK installed in order to compile this solution file.

A few quick tips to get the app up and running:
- This is a Visual Studio 2010 project using .NET framework 4.0
- You need to download and install Windows SDK and a fresh copy of the DirectX SDK
  - Get DirectX from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx
  - Get Windows SDK from http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/aa904949.aspx
  - Get SlimdX from http://aforge.com/Slimdx.rar
- You need to disable the loader lock exception in Visual Studio (Debug -> Exceptions -> Managed Debugging assistents -> Disable the "Loader lock" checkbox)
  - Do this by right clicking the project and selecting "Set as start project" from the context menu

Once you have completed these steps, the solution should compile.
Since this application is using the Microsoft Speech API, it should not be working with Windows XP versions prior SP2.
